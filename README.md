# Podman-Nginx
This repository contains notes and commands from a hands-on session using the **Podman** command-line tool within a Kali Linux environment.

### What I Learned and Performed

I spent a productive day diving into **containerization** and learned how to use **Podman** to manage containers, specifically by pulling and running an **Nginx** container.

During this session, I ran through a series of key commands to:
* **Pull a container image**: `podman pull`
* **List images and running containers**: `podman images`, `podman ps`
* **Start a container with a custom name and port mapping**: `podman run -d --name`, `-p`
* **Verify the running service**: `curl http://localhost:8080`
* **Remove containers and images**: `podman rm`, `podman rmi`

This was a valuable experience in understanding the fundamentals of container management and how Podman provides a secure, daemonless alternative to Docker.
